# Devops Mentorship Program

## Introduction

Welcome to my DevOps Mentorship repo. This repository serves as a demonstration of my progress and studies as I work towards becoming a DevOps engineer. Here, you will find a comprehensive overview of the various skills and technologies I have explored and implemented throughout my journey.

## Git Comands 

During my mentorship program, I gained proficiency in utilizing Git for version control. I became familiar with fundamental Git commands, such as git init, git clone, git add, git commit, and git push, git checkout and etc enabling me to effectively manage and track changes in my projects.

## Linux Administration
As a DevOps engineer, I recognized the significance of Linux in the deployment and management of applications. Throughout my mentorship, I delved into Linux administration, acquiring skills in tasks like user management, file permissions, package management, and shell scripting. These abilities equipped me to navigate and administer Linux systems with ease.

My work with Linux Administration is demonstrated at folder 
week-2. 

## EC2 Instance and Node.js Application Deployment
I successfully deployed a Node.js application on an EC2 instance. Leveraging my knowledge of Linux and Git, I set up the necessary environment, configured dependencies, and launched the application. This hands-on experience allowed me to understand the intricacies of deploying web applications on cloud infrastructure.

My work with EC2 Instance and Node.js Application Deployment is demonstrated at folder 
week-7. 

## Cost Alert Configuration
To ensure cost optimization and resource management, I implemented a cost alert system. I configured the necessary settings to receive notifications whenever certain cost thresholds were exceeded. This proactive approach helps maintain control over expenses and provides valuable insights for optimizing cloud resources.

My work with Cost Alert Configuration is demonstrated at folder week-7. 

## AMI Image Creation
During my mentorship, I created an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from my EC2 instance. This process involved capturing the state of the instance and saving it as a reusable template. By mastering this skill, I gained proficiency in creating and launching instances with preconfigured environments.

My work with AMI Image Creation is demonstrated at folder week-8. 
## Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group
I explored the concept of load balancing and implemented an auto scaling group. I set up a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. With the auto scaling group, I automated the scaling process based on predefined conditions, allowing the application to handle varying traffic demands efficiently.

My work with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group is demonstrated at folder week-8. 

## Security Group Configuration
Understanding the importance of security, I created and configured security groups. By defining inbound and outbound traffic rules, I ensured that my infrastructure remained protected from unauthorized access. This knowledge enabled me to design robust and secure network architectures.

My work with Security Group Configuration is demonstrated at folder week-8. 


## SSL Certificate Creation
I demonstrated proficiency in setting up SSL certificates for secure communication between clients and servers. I successfully created SSL certificates using both Let's Encrypt and Certbot, as well as the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). This expertise enables me to establish encrypted connections and enhance the security of applications.

My work with SSL Certificate Creation is demonstrated at folder week-9. 

## S3 Bucket and Static Website
I utilized Amazon S3 to create a bucket and hosted a static website. By uploading an index.html file and an error.html page, I configured the bucket to serve these files as a simple website. This experience allowed me to understand the fundamentals of hosting static content in the cloud.

My work with S3 Bucket and Static Website is demonstrated at folder week-11. 

## CloudFront and Origin Configuration
I published my application via Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN). I modified various configurations, including the origin domain, name, viewer protocol policy (redirecting HTTP to HTTPS), and custom SSL certificate settings. By leveraging CloudFront, I improved the performance, scalability, and security of my application.

My work with CloudFront and Origin Configuration is demonstrated at folder week-11.
